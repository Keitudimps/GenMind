# App Name
GenMind

# Description
GenMind is a light-themed, AI-powered content generator focused on frontend UI design. It allows users to describe a user interface in natural language and receive both a visual spec and fully downloadable code for that UI. Powered by Google Gemini for intelligent design/code generation.

# Overview
Users describe the UI they want (e.g., "A modern dashboard with cards and dark sidebar"). GenMind analyzes the prompt using Gemini Pro, generates a short design explanation, and outputs working frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS or React). The result is shown live and available for download.

# Features
- 🖋️ UI Prompt Input – Natural language prompt for UI design
- 📄 Design Spec Generator – Summarizes what the UI will include and how it looks
- 💻 Code Generator – Produces working frontend code using Gemini Pro (HTML/CSS/JS or React)
- 🧪 Live Preview – Shows a rendered preview of the UI (optional iframe or sandbox)
- 📥 Download Button – User can download the full code as a file (e.g., `.zip`, `.html`, or `.jsx`)
- 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout
